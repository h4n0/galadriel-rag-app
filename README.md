## Query and result

### Query

Explain Galadriel's technology stack, strategy and vision

### Context
https://docs.galadriel.com/litepaper

### Result 

Based on the provided context, here's an explanation of Galadriel's technology stack, strategy, and vision:

**Technology Stack:**

Galadriel's technology stack is built on a parallel execution EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) stack, specifically off Cosmos-SDK and Sei v2. This stack is designed to provide a scalable and decentralized platform for building AI applications and agents.

**Strategy:**

Galadriel's strategy is to become the first Layer 1 (L1) blockchain for AI, enabling developers to build decentralized and autonomous AI agents and applications. The team initially started building Galadriel as an L2 but realized that vertical integration is necessary to achieve full decentralization and autonomy. By building a purpose-built platform, Galadriel aims to reduce the cost and latency overhead associated with traditional blockchain architectures.

**Vision:**

Galadriel's vision is to become the application layer for AI, providing a decentralized and trustless platform for developers to build and deploy AI applications and agents. The team's goal is to empower developers to be the masters of their destiny, ensuring that they have control over their AI applications and are not subject to rug-pulls or centralized control. By achieving this vision, Galadriel aims to unlock the full potential of AI and enable a new generation of decentralized and autonomous AI applications.
